Okay, here are 5 lines about Kabaddi:

1.  Kabaddi is a contact team sport that originated in India.
2.  The objective is for a single player ("raider") to enter the opposing team's half of the court, tag as many defenders as possible, and return to their own half without being tackled.
3.  Points are scored for successful tags and tackles.
4.  Matches are typically 40 minutes long with a half-time break.
5.  It requires strength, agility, and strategy and is popular in South Asia.

Now, can I help you with anything else related to your project, such as JIRA tasks, GitHub updates, or API documentation?
