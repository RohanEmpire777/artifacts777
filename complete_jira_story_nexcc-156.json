Okay, I can help you store the complete JIRA story in your GitHub repository: `RohanEmpire777/artifacts777`.

To store the JIRA story, I need you to specify a filename. I suggest storing it as a JSON file so it's easily readable and parsable.

For example, you can use the command:

`store to github complete_jira_story_NEXCC-1.json`

This will save the complete JIRA story as `complete_jira_story_NEXCC-1.json` in your repository `RohanEmpire777/artifacts777`. This file will contain all the information I just provided, including the original text, timestamp, and analysis.
