Okay, I understand. You want to store only the JSON content of test case 1 (`NEXCC-1_TC-001_Positive.json`) to GitHub, without any surrounding text or comments. I will remove all other surrounding text or comments and then save to github.

```json
{
    "testCaseId": "NEXCC-1_TC-001_Positive",
    "requirementId": "NEXCC-1-SCE-001-AgentLoginProductSelection",
    "jiraid": "NEXCC-1",
    "module": "Authentication & Product",
    "type": "Positive",
    "tags": ["API", "Positive", "Agent"],
    "priority": "High",
    "role": "Agent",
    "dependencies": [],
    "gherkin": [
      "Given an agent has valid credentials",
      "When I POST /API/auth/login with valid agent credentials",
      "Then I receive 200 and a valid token, user.id, and user.name in the response",
      "Given I have a valid token",
      "When I GET /API/product",
      "Then I receive 200 and a list of products with their id and name"
    ]
  }
```

store to github NEXCC-1_TC-001_Positive.json
