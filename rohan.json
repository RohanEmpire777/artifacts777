It likely serves as a central point for creating, updating, and retrieving sales information. The API is designed for managing product, agent, and agency details associated with a sale, including quantities, amounts, and policy status. The use of a gateway suggests a microservices architecture where this API aggregates or orchestrates calls to backend services.\",\n  \"Key endpoints and their purposes\": [\n    {\n      \"endpoint\": \"Inferred from data models: Likely POST /sales (for creating new sales) and PUT/PATCH /sales/{id} (for updating existing sales), GET /sales/{id} (retrieving single sale) and GET /sales (retrieving multiple sales). There are no endpoints explicitly defined, but this can be reasonably inferred from the data schemas.\",\n      \"purpose\": \"Based on the 'SaleUpsertPayload' and 'SaleUpsertResponse' schemas, these endpoints would facilitate Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on sales data.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"Data models and relationships\": {\n    \"SaleUpsertPayload\": {\n      \"description\": \"The data structure used for creating or updating sales records.\",\n      \"fields\": [\n        \"productId (string):  ID of the product sold.\",\n        \"productName (string): Name of the product.\",\n        \"agentId (string): ID of the agent who made the sale.\",\n        \"agentName (string): Name of the agent.\",\n        \"agencyId (string): ID of the agency associated with the sale (Optional).\",\n        \"agencyName (string): Name of the agency (Optional).\",\n        \"quantity (integer): Number of products sold.\",\n        \"totalAmount (number): Total amount of the sale.\",\n        \"saleDate (string, date-time): Date and time of the sale.\",\n        \"policyStatus (string): Status of the associated policy.\"\n      ],\n      \"relationships\": \"Relates to product, agent, and agency entities via their respective IDs.\"\n    },\n    \"SaleUpsertResponse\": {\n      \"description\": \"The data structure returned after a successful creation or update of a sales record.\",\n      \"fields\": [\n        \"_id (string): Unique identifier for the sales record.\",\n        \"id (string):  Duplicate of _id.
